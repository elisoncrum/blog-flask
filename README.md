I am trying to port this blog engine from 
my static site that uses outdated libraries and is spaghetti code 
https://github.com/elisoncrum/blog and elisoncrum.github.io/blog

I am trying to make it a medium level blog engine for people who are used to Reddit and Discords markdown it will take something like
```
````h1
this is a header
````

and turn it into

<h1>this is a header</h1>
```
