### **README**

> Goal of this program is to make creating blog really simple, mainly for individuals who used to Reddit and Discord markdown.

Turn something like this
````
    ```h1
    more stuff
    **bolded stuff**
    ```
````

into
```html
    <h1>more stuff</h1>
    <strong>bolded stuff</strong>
``` 

### **Old Program**

> Old Program was created with **JS** and has multiple libraries that are depreciated. The code is also clunky and spaghetti like. Important files are:
> 
> *   [article.js](https://github.com/elisoncrum/blog/blob/master/article.js)
> *   [article example](https://github.com/elisoncrum/blog/blob/master/articles/1.article)

### **New Program**

> So far I have ported the markup engine I created and I need it be rendered by jinja2. The data is correct and needs to be read by jinja. Articles are basically the same, date and title have been changed a bit but the markup is the same.

#### **Why?**

> I decided to use Jinja2 and Flask because it is dynamic and can be used with mySQL and Heroku. The static page was using depreciated libraries.
